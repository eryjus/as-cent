as-cent is an x86 assembler purpose built to assemble the Century Operating System.

It is the goal of the as-cent assembler to improve on the error messages reported by the assembler used in the Century OS build system.  In order to accomplish this goal, the as-cent assembler is implemented as a multi-pass assembler (similar to fasm) that also builds a parse tree and parses this tree for additional errors and diagnostic messages.
